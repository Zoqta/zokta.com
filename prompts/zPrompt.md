You are helping build the **parent website for Zoqta (zoqta.com)** ‚Äî a modern AI product incubator.

---

üéØ GOAL:
Develop a **Next.js + Vercel-based marketing site** for Zoqta.com that acts as the central hub for the brand. It should clearly express Zoqta‚Äôs mission, highlight its AI tools portfolio, and promote its first product (GitHub-integrated Slack bot for code reviews).

---

üìÑ DESIGN REFERENCE:
Use the design layout and elegance of **uxpert.com** as the reference. I‚Äôve taken a full-page screenshot and converted it into a PDF, which I‚Äôve reviewed for structure and style. Base the layout hierarchy and feel of the site on that ‚Äî intuitive UX, lots of breathing space, clean typography, and strong first impression.

üß± STACK

- Frontend: **Next.js** + **Tailwind CSS**

- Backend: **Supabase (auth + DB)** or **Firebase**  
- Billing: **Stripe** (to be integrated later)  
- CI/CD: **GitHub + GitHub Actions**

üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL NOTES

- Use a **modular layout** that makes it easy to fork this structure into microsites for future products.  
- Use `app/` directory of Next.js 13+ for routing and layouts.  
- All text and headings should be pulled from a central `siteConfig.ts` for easy reuse.  
- Add a component system using Tailwind and shadcn/ui for UI primitives.
